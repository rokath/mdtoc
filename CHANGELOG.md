### <a id='unreleased-overview'></a>Unreleased Overview

* CLI usability improved for interactive use:
  * `generate`, `strip`, and `check` now fail fast when no `--file` is given and no input is piped via `stdin`
  * this resolves confusing blocking behavior described in [#4](https://github.com/rokath/mdtoc/issues/4)
* Test coverage and regression protection were expanded:
  * overall statement coverage was raised above 90%
  * `cmd/mdtoc` is now test-covered
  * additional parser, config, CLI, process, and helper branches are verified directly
* Code and test documentation were normalized:
  * missing comments were added for exported and non-exported functions, structs, and test functions
* README and project docs were refined:
  * badges were refreshed and aligned to `mdtoc`
  * the README now doubles as a nested ToC example and usage demo
  * comparison docs were renamed from `replacement-tools-comparison` to `tools-comparison`
